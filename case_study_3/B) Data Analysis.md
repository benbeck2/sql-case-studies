## 2. What is the monthly distribution of `trial` plan `start_date` values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
```sql 
SELECT 
  DATEPART(MONTH, start_date) as month,
  COUNT(customer_id) as trials_count
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY DATEPART(MONTH, start_date)
ORDER BY 1;
```

## 3. What plan `start_date` values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each `plan_name`
```sql
SELECT 
  p.plan_name,
  COUNT(s.plan_id) as events

        AND
        LAG(plan_id) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) = 0 --trial plan
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END as is_churned
  FROM subscriptions
)

SELECT 
  SUM(is_churned) as churned_customers,
  FLOOR(SUM(is_churned) / CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS float) * 100) as churn_perct
FROM churned_after_trial;
```

    -- will be used to get the plan directly after the free trial
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) as plan_order
  FROM subscriptions
  WHERE plan_id <> 0
)

SELECT
  p2.plan_name,
  COUNT(p1.plan_id) AS plans_after_trial,
  COUNT(p1.plan_id) / @total_cust * 100 AS percentage
FROM
  plans_after_trial p1
  JOIN plans p2
  ON p1.plan_id = p2.plan_id
WHERE p1.plan_order = 1
GROUP BY p2.plan_name;
```

  FROM subscriptions
  WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31'

    customer_id,
    plan_id,
    -- order by descending start date to get the latest plan of each customer
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date DESC) as plan_reverse_order
  FROM subscriptions
  WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31'

  COUNT(cp.customer_id) / @total_cust * 100 AS customers_perct
FROM
  customer_plans cp
  JOIN plans p
  ON cp.plan_id = p.plan_id

## 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
```sql
WITH trial_plan AS(
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    start_date AS join_date
  FROM subscriptions
  WHERE plan_id = 0
),
annual_plan AS(
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    start_date AS annual_start_date
  FROM subscriptions
  WHERE plan_id = 3
),
buckets AS(
  SELECT 
    tp.customer_id,
    join_date,
    annual_start_date,
    -- create buckets of 30 days period from 1 to 12 (i.e monthly buckets)
    DATEDIFF(DAY, join_date, annual_start_date)/30 + 1 AS bucket
  FROM 
    trial_plan tp
    JOIN annual_plan ap
    ON tp.customer_id = ap.customer_id
)

SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN bucket = 1 THEN CONCAT(bucket-1, ' - ', bucket*30, ' days')
    ELSE CONCAT((bucket-1)*30 + 1, ' - ', bucket*30, ' days')
  END AS period,
  COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers,
  CAST(AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, join_date, annual_start_date)*1.0) AS decimal(5, 2)) AS average_days
FROM buckets
GROUP BY bucket;
```

  SELECT
    CASE 
      WHEN 
        plan_id = 2  --pro monthly plan 
        AND
        LEAD(plan_id) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) = 1  --basic monthly plan
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END as is_downgraded
  FROM subscriptions
