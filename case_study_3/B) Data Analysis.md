## 2. What is the monthly distribution of `trial` plan `start_date` values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
```sql 
SELECT 
  DATEPART(MONTH, start_date) as month,
  COUNT(customer_id) as trials_count
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY DATEPART(MONTH, start_date)
ORDER BY 1;
```

## 3. What plan `start_date` values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each `plan_name`
```sql
SELECT 
  p.plan_name,
  COUNT(s.plan_id) as events
FROM 
  subscriptions s
  JOIN plans p
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE DATEPART(YEAR, start_date) > 2020 
GROUP BY p.plan_name;
```

## 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
```sql
DECLARE @total_cust float = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions);

SELECT
  COUNT(customer_id) as customers_churned,
  (COUNT(customer_id) / @total_cust) * 100 as churned_perct
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 4;
```

## 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
```sql
WITH churned_after_trial AS(
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    CASE 
      WHEN 
        plan_id = 4  --churn plan
        AND
        LAG(plan_id) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) = 0 --trial plan
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END as is_churned
  FROM subscriptions
)

SELECT 
  SUM(is_churned) as churned_customers,
  FLOOR(SUM(is_churned) / CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS float) * 100) as churn_perct
FROM churned_after_trial;
```

    plan_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) as plan_order
  FROM subscriptions
  WHERE plan_id <> 0
)

SELECT
  p2.plan_name,
  COUNT(p1.plan_id) AS plans_after_trial,
  COUNT(p1.plan_id) / @total_cust * 100 AS percentage
FROM
  plans_after_trial p1
  JOIN plans p2
  ON p1.plan_id = p2.plan_id
WHERE p1.plan_order = 1
GROUP BY p2.plan_name;
